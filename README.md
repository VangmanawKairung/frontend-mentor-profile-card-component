### What I learned

One of the key things I learned in this project was how to properly position background images in CSS. Since background placement depends on the screen size, I experimented with different values and used functions like `calc()` to fine-tune the positions. This helped me understand background positioning more deeply and made me more confident in handling responsive layouts.

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to focus on writing cleaner and more concise CSS. I believe there are opportunities to group styles more effectively and use variables or snippets in a way that reduces repetition. Improving the structure and maintainability of my code will make it easier to scale and more professional overall. I also want to keep practicing responsive design techniques to ensure my layouts adapt smoothly across different screen sizes.
